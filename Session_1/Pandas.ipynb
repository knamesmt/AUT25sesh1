Medium-bodied and creamy, the Merlot gives this wine a feminine feel, despite solid, soft tannins. Dark, extracted black fruits have some accents of forest and black olive, while leather adds to the cherry and cassis nose. Could use time to soften further, but very approachable now.",

It's dark coffee-brown in color, with delectable aromas of rancio, dried fig, molasses and black tea, yet despite enormous concentration avoids excessive weight. And it's amazingly complex and fresh on the nearly endless finish.",

    "Summary functions allow us to quickly describe and understand a dataset by computing key statistics. Common examples include `.mean()`, `.median()`, `.min()`, `.max()`, and `.sum()` for numerical data, as well as `.value_counts()` for categorical data. These functions can be applied to entire DataFrames or specific columns, giving us insights such as average values, distributions, and totals. Using `.describe()` provides a convenient overview of multiple summary statistics at once.\n"
